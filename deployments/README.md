## DEPLOYMENT

- In Kubernetes (K8s), a Deployment is an abstraction that helps manage the lifecycle of applications, including the creation, scaling, and updating of Pods. 
- It automates the process of rolling out changes to your application, ensuring availability, and providing a declarative method to describe the desired state of your application.
- It provides a way to declare the desired state of an application and let Kubernetes maintain it over time. It ensures that a specific number of replicas (Pods) of an application are running at all times, and it handles updates and rollbacks automatically.
