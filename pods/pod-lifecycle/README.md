## POD LIFECYCLE:

- The pod lifecycle in Kubernetes is a crucial aspect that outlines the various states a pod undergoes from creation to termination.
- Understanding this lifecycle is essential for developers and administrators alike, as it provides insights into how Kubernetes manages resources, schedules workloads, and maintains application availability. 
- Pods, the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, can exist in several phases, including Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, and Unknown.

1. [**PENDING PHASE**](https://github.com/saimanasak/kubernetes/blob/main/pods/pod-lifecycle/examples/pending.md)
2. [**RUNNING PHASE**](https://github.com/saimanasak/kubernetes/blob/main/pods/pod-lifecycle/examples/running.md)
3. [**SUCCEEDED PHASE**](https://github.com/saimanasak/kubernetes/blob/main/pods/pod-lifecycle/examples/succeeded.md)
4. [**FAILURE PHASE**](https://github.com/saimanasak/kubernetes/blob/main/pods/pod-lifecycle/examples/failure.md)
